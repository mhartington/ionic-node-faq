<p>This helpful tip cannot be stressed enough! Even when working natively, the android emulator is a pain. Itâ€™s slow to boot, becomes unresponsive and locks up easily. Thankfully <a href="http://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a> is a great replacement. It uses a virtual machine to emulate android devices and does it perfectly. Once thing to remember, if you want to deploy to a genymotion device, your computer will treat it as an actual connect machine. So instead of running</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ ionic emulate android
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>run</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ ionic run android
</code></pre>
