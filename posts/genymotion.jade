  This helpful tip cannot be stressed enough! Even when working natively, the android emulator is a pain. Itâ€™s slow to boot, becomes unresponsive and locks up easily. Thankfully [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) is a great replacement. It uses a virtual machine to emulate android devices and does it perfectly. Once thing to remember, if you want to deploy to a genymotion device, your computer will treat it as an actual connect machine. So instead of running
  ```bash
  $ ionic emulate android
  ```
  Use `run` instead.
  ```bash
  $ ionic run android
  ```
