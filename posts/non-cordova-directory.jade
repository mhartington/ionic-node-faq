title: 'Current Working Directory is not Cordova-based project'

---

:markdown
  This one is pretty extreme and cause a lot of frustration. You try to use any of the Cordova/Ionic commands and get this error.
  ```bash
  Current Working Directory is not Cordova-based project
  ```
  At this point you’re unable to do anything further with your project. So why does this happen? Various reason, but mostly something gets corrupted with your environment configuration. You can see a [thread](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/2213#issuecomment-55912785) where this happened for one particular user.

  For his case, the solution was to run
  ```bash
  $ cordova create .
  ```

  Basically a hidden folder that should be there wasn’t. Running that command above fixes that issue.
