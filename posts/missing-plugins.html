<p>When you update an iOS project to a new version of Cordova, sometimes you will get an error saying it was unable to locate a plugin. You open up Xcode, try to run and build from there and get this error in your console.</p>

</code></pre><p>This can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common is manually adding files to the native project. The linking process during a build cycle gets broken and none of the native files are moved over. To fix this, delete the <code>ios.json</code> file in the plugins folder. This will make Cordova have to recopy all the plugin files.</p>
<p>In more extreme cases, sometimes a complete removal of the project is needed.</p>
