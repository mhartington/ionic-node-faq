<p>So you found this awesome plugin on github that you want to use for your app. So lets try to install it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">ionic plugin add http://github.com/user/awesome-plugin
</code></pre>
<p>But then another error comes up. Whats going on?
So something that Cordova doesn’t mention is that you need to have git setup for installing plugins from Github. Something like this can easily be overlooked, but thankfully it’s as easy to fix. Just visit <a href="http://git-scm.com/">the git website</a>, install and set up git, and you’re good to go.</p>
