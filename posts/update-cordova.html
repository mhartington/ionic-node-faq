<p>When Cordova pushes a new version, it’s always best to update. So you run this command to update the Cordova binaries.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ sudo npm update -g cordova
</code></pre>
<p>Great, but when you try to do anything in a project, you’ll get an error. Well this is because there are actually different versions of Cordova for each platform. So from inside your project you need to run Cordova’s update command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ cordova update platform ios
$ cordova update platform android
</code></pre>
<p>Now all your platform specific versions of Cordova are updated.</p>
